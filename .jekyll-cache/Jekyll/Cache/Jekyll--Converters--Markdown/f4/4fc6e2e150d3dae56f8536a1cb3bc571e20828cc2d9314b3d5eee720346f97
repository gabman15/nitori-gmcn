<p>Switches: Alps SKCC Cream</p>

<p>Date: Unknown</p>

<p>Origin: The keyboard for the scanning machine known as the Kurzweil 4000. This
appears to be a computer system that would take in typed paper and read the typed
words into memory.</p>

<p>Pretty dirty board from ebay but it was cheap and looks awesome. After cleaning:</p>

<p>Some of the buttons on this keyboard appear to show keys
to begin scanning and perform tasks related to font recognition.</p>

<p>There really isnâ€™t a lot of information about this system on the internet.
Here are all the interesting documents about the device I have found,</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t found any manuals for the keyboard interface, and I believe the
keyboard is set up in a way that it requires all the processing for the key
inputs to be done on the computerâ€™s side. This means Iâ€™d basically have to hook
into the matrix with a teensy to properly convert it. I havenâ€™t done much
tinkering with it yet but thatâ€™s where the conversion stands for now.</p>
