I picked up a Roku 2 XS recently at a workshop at my university. It's basically
an obselete piece of tech at this point, I already have a smart tv that does
practically the same thing. So I decided I would take it apart and see if I
could get custom firmware on it. After my foray into didj hacking, I hoped
those skills could transfer over and flash another kernel over uart or
something.
