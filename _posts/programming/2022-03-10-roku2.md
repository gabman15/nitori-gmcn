I picked up a Roku 2 XS recently at a workshop at my university. It's basically
an obselete piece of tech at this point, I already have a smart tv that does
practically the same thing. So I decided I would take it apart and see if I
could get custom firmware on it. After my foray into didj hacking, I hoped
those skills could transfer over and flash another linux kernel over uart or
something. 

First thing was to check the firmware version of the device so I booted it up
and checked the system settings page.

The important takeaway is that the software version is 9.1.0 build 5009-02

This is important because after doing a bit of research I came across this article

[<span style="color:#7b9cc9">Exploiting Roku</span>](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/kurzweil-4000/index.htmlhttps://www.exploitee.rs/index.php/Exploiting_Roku)

I was hoping because of how old the Roku 2 XS is, it might still be vulnerable to
this exploit. This exploit would give me a root terminal over the network(telnet in
this case) that I could dump firmware, reflash new firmware and run custom code.

After making a roku account (and figuring out how to bypass the credit card info page
because screw you roku for wanting that), I was able to access the developer page
and typed the telnetd command into the password prompt and unfortunately got nothing.

It appears the bug had been patched almost as soon as it was released. So back to the
drawing board.

Next I wanted to take a look at the hardware aspect of the device to see if I could
find an attack vector that way.

I am relatively familiar with uart exploitation after my didj hacking project.
The uart port is a set of pins on a lot of circuit boards that has two data
pins (a receiving data pin (rx) and a transmitting data pin (tx)), a power pin,
and a ground pin. Connecting to a uart port might give me a root terminal.

I didn't initially see the 4 pins in a row that would be a dead giveaway for a uart.

First thing I did was take a look at some of the chips on the board to see if I could find
the pinout for any.

I found a website with a vague info sheet for the processor which showed that it did
have uart support on the chip.

I have a major issue with chip manufacturers not publishing at least a very basic pinout
and documentation. They clearly have them and provide them to their customer
companies (roku in this case) but don't want to provide them to the public
for some reason. The layman is not going to attempt to hack a device via a chip's
pinout, meanwhile a dedicated hacker can reverse engineer a chip given enough time.
There seems to be no real reason to not release this information other than
wanting to discourage knowledge of the electronics that we own.

Tirade aside, it was time to start looking for the uart signal I now know must
exist.
After looking around on the board for a while and poking at it with a multimeter,
I figured that these pins here probably contained a uart signal.
