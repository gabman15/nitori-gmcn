Manufacturer: Apple and Alps

Switches: Cream damped Alps

Origin: A keyboard that was shipped with Apple Macintosh computers in the
early 1990s. The last mechanical keyboard produced by Apple (and the end of competent apple products)

<span style="font-size:35px">Restoration Information</span>

Bought this board from some guy on Facebook Marketplace who had been holding it in storage.

The interior of the board is filthy!

Conversion time!

Unfortunately this was one of my many early projects that led to failure.
The most important thing I want to stress with these conversions is to attempt
to not change any of the internals as much as possible. My ideal conversion
would be that if I were to get the original machine a keyboard came with, I
would still be able to use the same keyboard.

Unfortunately I didn't have the same mindset as I now do so I attempted some
very janky conversion to try and shove a microcontroller into the board by
chopping off the adb port board

(not my board)

and soldering a pro micro to the wires in that gray cable as seen in the picture.

This did not work at all. The wire wouldn't let me separate each wire individually very well.
I decided to just solder wires to the solder points on the board. I messed up this solder job too.
After many attempts. I put arduino wires into the other adb connector which makes much more sense.
However even after flashing the soarer's firmware, it didn't send anything. I
have a bit of a fear that I may have either put a wire in wrong or messed up
the soldering and shorted out a chip or something.

This is where the restoration currently stands. A mangled pcb with bad soldering
and a chopped wire. My current plans going forward are to either debug the pcb,
checking if there are shorted pins or broken traces or to replace the pcb
entirely with kb-elmo's
[<span style="color:#7b9cc9">AEK II USB replacement board</span>](https://github.com/kb-elmo/aek2_usb).
I'd prefer if I could use the same pcb so that it would still be adb compatible,
however if the pcb really is broken then this is better than nothing.
