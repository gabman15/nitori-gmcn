I found a e-recycling center in my hometown and decided to drop by one fine Saturday morning.
I was told I could take stuff for free as long as I didn't take any hard drives from any computers.
I didn't find much other than this beautiful keyboard. Hindsight says I could have potentially found
the terminal for this keyboard (the WY-50) but I didn't really know what the keyboard was when I picked
it up.

First thing I notice is the connector. It is nothing like any vintage keyboard connector I've seen
before.

Well let's take a look at the pcb.
