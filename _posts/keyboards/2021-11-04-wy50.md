I found a e-recycling center in my hometown and decided to drop by one fine Saturday morning.
I was told I could take stuff for free as long as I didn't take any hard drives from any computers.
I didn't find much other than this beautiful keyboard. Hindsight says I could have potentially found
the terminal for this keyboard (the WY-50) but I didn't really know what the keyboard was when I picked
it up.

First thing I notice is this 10 pin connector. It is nothing like any vintage keyboard connector I've seen
before.

Well let's take a look at the pcb.

Front section (these 4 chips you can see at the top will become extremely relevent later)

At this point I have no real idea of how to proceed to try to convert it to usb as I have never
seen this protocol before. So begins the research phase!

<span style="font-size:35px">Research Time</span>

So I first wanted to understand what I was researching for. I decided I would map out the
ENTIRE circuit board so I could well and truly understand this keyboard through and through.
I took high resolution images of parts of the circuit board and cropped them together
to make a giant image so I could see each trace individually. And here is that image:
(unfortunately can't include the entire high resolution image but this looks good enough)

The eagle eyed among you will notice the positive and ground are swapped so black is 5V and red
is ground, so apologies for that. This actually had me confused for the longest time as well.

Also I apparently didn't add the lines for the modifier keys because I didn't quite understand how
the 3 diodes on the top left of the pcb played into it. (Still kinda don't but its not important for
my current plan)
