<span style="font-size:35px">Restoration Information</span>

I found a e-recycling center in my hometown and decided to drop by one fine Saturday morning.
I was told I could take stuff for free as long as I didn't take any hard drives from any computers.
I didn't find much other than this beautiful keyboard. Hindsight says I could have potentially found
the terminal for this keyboard (the WY-50) but I didn't really know what the keyboard was when I picked
it up.

First thing I notice is the connector. It is nothing like any vintage keyboard connector I've seen
before.

Well let's take a look at the pcb.

Front section (these 4 chips you can see at the top will become extremely relevent later)

So this connector has 10 pins and you can see the white connector at the top left of the front
of the board.

At this point I have no real idea of how to proceed to try to convert it to usb as I have never
seen this protocol before. So begins the research phase!

<span style="font-size:35px">Research Time</span>

So first thing I wanted to do was to be fully ready to understand what I was researching for.
I decided I would map out the ENTIRE circuit board so I could well and truly understand this keyboard
through and through. I took high resolution images of parts of the circuit board and cropped them together
to make a giant image so I could see each trace individually. And here is that image:
(unfortunately can't include the entire high resolution image but this looks good enough)
