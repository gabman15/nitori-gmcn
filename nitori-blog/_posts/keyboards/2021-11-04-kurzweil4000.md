Origin: The keyboard for the scanning machine known as the Kurzweil 4000. This
appears to be a computer system that would take in typed paper and read the typed
words into memory.

Pretty dirty board from ebay but it was cheap and looks awesome. After cleaning:

Some of the buttons on this keyboard appear to show keys
to begin scanning and perform tasks related to font recognition.

There really isn't a lot of information about this system on the internet.
Here are all the interesting documents about the device I have found,

I haven't found any manuals for the keyboard interface, and I believe the
keyboard is set up in a way that it requires all the processing for the key
inputs to be done on the computer's side. This means I'd basically have to hook
into the matrix with a teensy to properly convert it. I haven't done much
tinkering with it yet but that's where the conversion stands for now.
