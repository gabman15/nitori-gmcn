Bought this board from some guy on Facebook Marketplace who had been holding it in storage.

The interior of the board is filthy!

Conversion time!

Unfortunately this was one of my many early projects that led to failure.
The most important thing I want to stress with these conversions is to attempt
to not change any of the internals as much as possible. My ideal conversion
would be that if I were to get the original machine a keyboard came with, I
would still be able to use the same keyboard.

Unfortunately I didn't have the same mindset as I now do so I attempted some
very janky conversion to try and shove a microcontroller into the board by
chopping off the adb port board

(not my board)

and soldering a pro micro to the wires in that gray cable seen in the picture.
