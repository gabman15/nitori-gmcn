# Blog nitori-gmcn
This is my personal blog where I'll post updates to my personal coding projects.
This will include my lifelong project of attempting to run the Bad Apple music video on
every electronic device with a screen or speaker. As well as a gallery of all the keyboards I currently
own as well as the restoration process I do for vintage keyboards.
