<p>Manufacturer: Apple and Alps</p>

<p>Switches: Cream damped Alps</p>

<p>Date: 1990-1995</p>

<p>Origin: A keyboard that was shipped with Apple Macintosh computers in the
early 1990s. The last mechanical keyboard produced by Apple (and the end of competent apple products)</p>

<p>Bought this board from some guy on Facebook Marketplace who had been holding it in storage.</p>

<p>The interior of the board is filthy!</p>

<p>Conversion time!</p>

<p>Unfortunately this was one of my many early projects that led to failure.
The most important thing I want to stress with these conversions is to attempt
to not change any of the internals as much as possible. My ideal conversion
would be that if I were to get the original machine a keyboard came with, I
would still be able to use the same keyboard.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I didn’t have the same mindset as I now do so I attempted some
very janky conversion to try and shove a microcontroller into the board by
chopping off the adb port board</p>

<p><img src="/images/aek2/aek2-4.jpg" alt="aek2adb" width="50%" />
(not my board)</p>

<p>and soldering a pro micro to the wires in that gray cable as seen in the picture.</p>

<p>This did not work at all. The wire wouldn’t let me separate each wire individually very well.
I decided to just solder wires to the solder points on the board. I messed up this solder job too.
After many attempts. I put arduino wires into the other adb connector which makes much more sense.
However even after flashing the soarer’s firmware, it didn’t send anything. I
have a bit of a fear that I may have either put a wire in wrong or messed up
the soldering and shorted out a chip or something.</p>

<p>This is where the restoration currently stands. A mangled pcb with bad soldering
and a chopped wire. My current plans going forward are to either debug the pcb,
checking if there are shorted pins or broken traces or to replace the pcb
entirely with kb-elmo’s

I’d prefer if I could use the same pcb so that it would still be adb compatible,
however if the pcb really is broken then this is better than nothing.</p>
